# TheStaircase

A simple tool to keep track of your progress training under TheStaircase methodology.

> TheStaircase is an alternative improvement method that focuses on creating a fun, and motivating experience for the player. It utilizes unit constrictions to prevent the player from being overwhelmed by the complexity of the game, and to encourage creativity and exploration. It uses measurable benchmarks for the absolute core elements of Starcraft 2: Gathering and spending resources efficiently. These benchmarks are recorded using ~~GGTracker~~ GGGReplays, allowing the player to devote all of their attention to playing the game.
